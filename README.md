## Analysis

### 1. Number of Records
Total number of records were 12 billion. People seem to ride more bikes in the summer than in the winter. The possible reason could be that people are not willing to ride outside in winter due to the cold weather.
September 2019 had the lowest number of records, while April 2020 had the lowest number of records.



### 2. Top/Bottom Ten Stations
Top ten stations for both ending and starting a journey are Grove St.



### 3. Peak Hours
Rush hours(8:00am and 5:00pm - 6:00pm) seem to be the peak hours for riders.


### 4. Trip Distance and Duration by Age
If we look at the records by age, highest number of records were recorded by people aged 51, although majority of the users are aged between 25-44 years old. 
In terms of the distance and duration, most young users rode citi bikes for short distance, while the older people rode for longer distance and duration.
It is clear that men ride way more citi bikes than women and unknown gender.
